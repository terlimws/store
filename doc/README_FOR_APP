Dear TAs:

This website is optimised for 1440 X 900 and 1024 X 768 screen resolutions. 

I changed the schema for the User table for the password reset. Kindly do a bundle install, as well as rake db:reset, db:populate, a db:migrate. :) 

Please log in as an admin using the following credentials:
Email: admin@creamery.com
Password: secret

Once logged in as an Admin, you can go to User to create new accounts for Managers and Employees.

Extra Stuff/Extra Credits:
1) Greets the log in user with the appropriate greeting depending on the time of the day in the dashboard.
2) Shows lowest employee-hours in the dashboard for Admins.
3) For Stores created, if there are no shifts and employees yet assigned to store, stores can be deleted.
4) For Jobs created and are not assigned to any shifts, they can be deleted.
5) For Employees created, if the employee has never worked a shift, he can be deleted. If he has worked any, he can only be deactivated.
6) Managers can only search for employees, view shifts for employees that are assigned to his/her store, while administrators can search for all, and both active/inactive employees.
7) Included a favicon.
