Dear TAs:

This website is optimised for 1440 X 900 and 1024 X 768 screen resolutions. 

I changed the schema for the User table for the password reset. Kindly do a bundle install, as well as rake db:reset, db:populate, a db:migrate. :) 

You might need to use console to create a User first. i.e.
User.new(:email => "admin@creamery.com", :password => "1234", :employee_id => 1)
Employee id: 1 is an Admin. Upon Login, you can create more user accounts!

Also, because I'm using the 'less' gem, After cloning the project, you might also face this issue and obtain this error:
Cannot call method 'charAt' of undefined
... app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less

If that happens, please go to the Gemfile and comment out gem 'less-rails-bootstrap', and rerun bundle install.

The solution can be found here:

It worked perfectly fine on my computer :)

Extra Stuff/Extra Credits:
1) Greets the log in user with the appropriate greeting depending on the time of the day in the dashboard.
2) Shows lowest employee-hours in the dashboard for Admins.
3) For Stores created, if there are no shifts and employees yet assigned to store, stores can be deleted.
4) For Jobs created and are not assigned to any shifts, they can be deleted.
5) For Employees created, if the employee has never worked a shift, he can be deleted. If he has worked any, he can only be deactivated.
6) Managers can only search for employees, view shifts for employees that are assigned to his/her store, while administrators can search for all, and both active/inactive employees.
7) Included a favicon.
